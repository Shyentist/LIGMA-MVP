# LIGMA-MVP
A small demo for LIGMA

Demo available at: https://shyentist.github.io/LIGMA-MVP/

## What is LIGMA?
Laboratory Instrument for Group Management of Assets (LIGMA) is a user-friendly LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) I am developing for a prospective client. This MVP/Demo is a simplification of the full-stack web dashboard I already built with the same functionality, so some leftover functions for connecting to the database can be found in the code. It is planned to ultimately make LIGMA Open-Source, just not now.
